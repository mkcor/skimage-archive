## Agenda

### Review of the week

- Week 7: [Timeline](https://hackmd.io/@mkcor/outreachy-roadmap)
    - It's too early to submit a PR!
    - Getting a hold of the data hasn't been trivial.
    - Didn't expect this (to this extent). 
- Got started with `pyklb`.
    - Reads KLB files into NumPy arrays.
    - Works at least in a minimal, 'clean' environment.
    - If needed, will save and load the arrays.

### Career opportunities

- Outreachy's theme for Week 7.
- Ananya is looking for research internships in academia.
- Ananya will ask Marianne for recommendation letters when she applies.
- Open source + open science
- [DOI](https://www.doi.org/)s aren't just for papers (see [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/)).
- See also [ORCiD](https://orcid.org/).

### 2D segmentation
